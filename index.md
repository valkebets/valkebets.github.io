My name is Valeria Kebets and I'm a [computational neuroscientist](https://valkebets.github.io/about/) with expertise in applied and academic research in AI and neuroscience. I lead the AI adoption team at Concordia University's Applied AI Institute where we develop end-to-end AI solutions for industry, non-profit organisations and government. 

You can take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/valkebets) for some projects that I've worked on, read more about my [research](https://valkebets.github.io/research/) and [view my CV](https://valkebets.github.io/cv/).
