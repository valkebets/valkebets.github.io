My name is Valeria Kebets and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University. I work on identifying neuroimaging-based markers underlying psychiatric and neurodevelopmental symptoms, using cutting edge neuroimaging, brain network analysis, and multivariate techniques based on large-scale datasets. <br/>
<br/>
I carried out my PhD in Switzerland with Dr. Dimitri Van De Ville and Dr. Frédéric Assal with the goal of developing imaging-based markers of neurodegenerative conditions, in particular functional neuroimaging patterns that might reliably predict progression to dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. During my postdoctoral training with Dr. Thomas Yeo in Singapore and with Dr. Camille Piguet in Geneva, I transitioned to psychiatric neuroscience with the aim of developing brain-based biomarkers that cut across psychiatric boundaries by capturing transdiagnostic symptomatology. In 2021, I joined Dr. Boris Bernhardt’s lab at McGill University, where my work aims at validating these markers in young adolescents, which might help predict future psychopathology. <br/>
