My name is Valeria Kebets and I'm a postdoc at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). I work on identifying transdiagnostic brain-behavior associations related to psychiatic and neurodevelopmental disorders. You can find my [CV] (https://valkebets.github.io/cv/), and learn about my [research projects] (https://valkebets.github.io/research/).
